## Project Overview 📖

**SapiensData** is a web application platform designed to manage personal accounting through advanced data receipt management, analysis, and visualization. Utilizing AI models, this application allows users to capture, analyze, and visualize their financial data from receipts, enabling better financial management and decision-making.

## Project Description 📝

SapiensData enables users to upload images of their receipts, which are then processed using AI models for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The application extracts and organizes receipt data into a user-friendly format, allowing users to analyze their spending habits and visualize financial trends.

This project is divided into several subprojects:

- **[Web Application](https://github.com/SapiensData/web-app)**
- **[SapiensDataAPI](https://github.com/SapiensData/api)**
- **[Analytics](https://github.com/SapiensData/analytics)**

and each subproject has its own README.md included in itself.

## Usage Instructions 🖥️

1. Upload a receipt image through the web interface.
2. Confirm the edges detected in the image.
3. Review and edit the extracted text if necessary.
4. Save the processed data for further analysis.
5. Explore visualizations of your spending patterns.

## Future Plans 🚀

- Integration of machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Development of a mobile app version.
- Additional visualizations for more comprehensive financial insights.
